                    <h1>History</h1> 
                    <br>
                    <p> The Muthuvan tribal community was the early inhabitants of Munnar and till the second half of the 19
                        th century, it was still unexplored and wild. Later, Munnar was developed as a plantation town by
                        John Daniel Munro, the then British resident to Travancore. This hill station was under the control
                        of the Travancore kingdom however the royal family of Poonjar was the landlord of the region. It was
                        the jenmam land of Poonjar royal family. Munro found that out of the many hills of Munnar, Kanan
                        Devan hills have the perfect condition for the plantation. Munro met Rohini Thirunal Kerala Varma
                        Valiya Raja, the head of the Poonjar royal family regarding his plantation plan. Rohini Thirunal
                        agreed to give the Kanan Devan hills on lease to Munro. In 1877, the hills that comprised of around
                        1,36,600 acres of land was leased out to John Daniel Munro by Poonjattil Koickal Rohini Thirunal
                        Kerala Varma Valiya Raja for an annual sum of Rs 3,000. Munro also had to pay a deposit of Rs 5,000
                        for the land.In 1879, Munro established the North Travancore Land Planting & Agricultural Society.
                        The cultivation of crops like sisal, cardamom and coffee were started in several parts of this
                        region by the members of the aforementioned society. The cultivation of these crops was later
                        discontinued after finding that tea is the ideal crop for this hilly region. Tea cultivation was
                        started by a European planter, A.H. Sharp, in 1880. About 50 acres of area at Parvathy was used for
                        the tea plantation by Sharp. Parvathy is presently the Seven Mallay estate’s part. James Finlay and
                        Company Limited (Finlay Muir & Company) started tea plantation in this region in 1895. A total of 33
                        independent estates were purchased by the firm. To manage these estates, the Kannan Devan Hills
                        Produce Company was established in 1897.Munnar gained popularity as a tourist destination in the
                        second half of 20 th century. The hill station with its scenic beauty and colonial charm attracted
                        many tourists. Several hotels and guesthouses cropped up to cater to this steady stream of visitors.
                        People flock to this place to see the lush greenery and the sprawling tea plantation. Other
                        interesting places to visit in Munnar include Chinnar, Thattekad and Eravikulam wildlife
                        sanctuaries. These protected areas are home to many of the endemic and threatened species like the
                        grizzled giant squirrel, the sambar, the gaur, elephants, Niligiri langur, the Nilgiri wood-pegion
                        and Nilgiri Thar. The valley is also famous for the Neelakurinju flowers that bloom once in 12
                        years. During this time, the valleys and hills get blanketed by the purple-blue blooms. Here is a
